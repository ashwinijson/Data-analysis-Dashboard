# Lead Management and Dashboard System in Google Sheets

## Project Overview:

Developed a dynamic Lead Management System using Google Sheets, designed to streamline
the distribution of leads and track agent performance efficiently. The system integrates multiple
worksheets to ensure seamless data flow and real-time reporting.

## Project Components:
• Master Sheet: Centralized hub for managing leads, assigning them to agents, and
consolidating feedback and status updates.

• Agent Sheets (3): Individual worksheets for each agent to receive leads, update statuses,
and provide feedback.

• Dashboard: Interactive dashboard reflecting real-time data from master and agent
sheets, providing insights on lead distribution, agent performance, and overall progress.

## Key Features:
1. Automated Lead Distribution: The master sheet assigns leads to agents automatically based
on predefined rules.
2. Two-Way Data Sync: Agents can update the status of leads and provide feedback, which is
instantly reflected in the master sheet.
3. Real-Time Dashboard: Provides visualization of key metrics such as number of leads handled
per agent, feedback status, and overall lead progress.
4. Data Integrity: Maintains accurate and consistent data across all sheets, preventing
duplication or data loss.
5. User-Friendly Interface: Simple, easy-to-use sheets with clear instructions for both master
and agent users.
